	<h2>Who Are They?</h2>
	<p>iKON is a South Korean boy band formed in 2015 by YG Entertainment. The group's seven members are B.I, Bobby, Kim Jinhwan, Koo Junhoe, Song Yunhyeong, Kim Donghyuk and Jung Chanwoo.
According to YG CEO Yang Hyun Suk, the "C" in "ICON" was replaced with a "K" Because he wanted them to become an 'icon' for Korea.
Although iKON made their official debut in 2015, the members were well known as Team B pre-debut due to the survival shows "Who is Next: Win" which was aired in 2013 and "Mix & Match" which was aired in 2014. The group made their official Korean debut on the 1st of October 2015 through their Debut Half Album - Welcome Back digital release and made their first debut broadcast on the 4th of October 2015 on SBS's Inkigayo.</p>

	<p>"Rhythm Ta" is a mid-tempo hip hop song with a catchy, head nodding beat and an addictive chorus. The video places iKON between a locker room, a basketball court, and various other street style backdrops. Alternating between white robes, t-shirts and jeans, and the red basketballs from the teaser poster iKON shows off not only their vocal skills but some smooth dance moves as well. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYI5CriE6XU">Music Video Link</a></p>

		<p>"Airplane," on the other hand, is a much softer love song. Similar to "My Type," "Airplane" focuses heavily on iKON's singing abilities in addition to highlighting their rapping. The video follows members B.I and Bobby and the love triangle they're caught between. Seeing Bobby and B.I act as the stars of the video only adds to the showcase of iKON's many abilities. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzHsIWx8UQ">Music Video Link</a></p>

	<p>Originally iKON were known as 'Team B' in 2013 to 2014 and had released several songs as part of a competition which was before their debut with the name iKON. Now in 2015, iKON officially debuted and their song sales dramatically increased which reflects the amount of popularity iKON has received.</p>
    
	<div id="chart_div"></div>
